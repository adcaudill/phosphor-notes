**A minimal, secure, and focused knowledge studio for the modern thinker.**

![Phosphor Notes Screenshot](/images/screenshot1.png)

Phosphor Notes is designed to bridge the gap between "outliner" tools (like Logseq) and "long-form" writing environments (like iA Writer). It is built on a simple philosophy: **Your thoughts belong to you.** There are no proprietary databases, no cloud lock-ins, and no subscriptions. Just a folder of plain text files, supercharged by a local graph engine.

Whether you are managing complex projects, journaling your daily life, or writing your next book, Phosphor adapts to your flow - offering a distraction-free writing experience when you need it, and a powerful task management engine when you don't.
