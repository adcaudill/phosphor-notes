# Phosphor Notes

_A minimal, encrypted note-taking application for the modern knowledge worker._

Phosphor Notes is a lightweight note-taking Electron app built with React and TypeScript. It
focuses on simple Markdown editing and local vaults (folders of .md files) with basic
wiki-style [[links]] and a background indexer that builds a link graph for backlinks.

⚠️ WARNING: This project is under active development and may be unstable. Expect breaking
